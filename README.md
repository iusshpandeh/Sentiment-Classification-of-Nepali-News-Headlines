Sentiment Classification of Nepali News headlines.

This was created was a final year project for CsIT.

I scraped multiple news websites to collect the headlines and labeled them as Positive and Negative. About 5500 headlines in Nepali are classified as Positive and Negative. The headlines can be found on headlines.txt

complete.ipynb is the Jupyter notebook file where the complete code is kept.

The accuracy, recall and precision was around 70%.
